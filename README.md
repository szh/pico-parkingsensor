# pico-parkingsensor
A simple Raspberry Pi Pico project to assist with parking in a garage.

Developed for the Pi Pico (first gen) using MicroPython. Uses an unltrasonic distance sensor
(HC-SR04) and a 12 LED NeoPixel ring (WS2812B). Recommended housing is a 3D printed case such
as this one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3534419.

This evolved from my previous project, https://github.com/szh/pi-parkingsensor, which was developed
for the Raspberry Pi Zero W which was overkill for the task.

Uses code from https://github.com/skgsergio/MicropythonLibs under the GPL-3.0 License.
